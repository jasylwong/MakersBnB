## <a name="Task">The Task</a>

Build a web application that allows users to list spaces they have available, and to hire spaces for the night.

It is based on the Makers [Week 6 group challenge](https://github.com/makersacademy/course/tree/master/makersbnb).

## <a name="Team">Team</a>

This app was created by the following developers:

[Megan Hayes](https://github.com/Megscode)
[Dafna Libman](https://github.com/Dlibmanw)
[Jack Overton](https://github.com/Ovy95)
[Ziad Soobratty](https://github.com/zsoobratty)
[Jason Wong](https://github.com/jasylwong)

## <a name="Installation">Installation</a>

1. Fork this repository, clone to your local machine then change into the directory:
```
$ git clone git@github.com:jasylwong/Makersbnb.git
$ cd Makersbnb
```

2. Load dependencies with bundle:
```
$ gem install bundle
$ bundle
```

3. Access to the database is controlled by an ORM, ActiveRecord. ActiveRecord rake tasks will are used to migrate the development and test databases. 

To migrate the development and test databases, please run the following command:
```
$ rake db:create
```

4. To poplulate the databases with the appropriate tables, run the following migrations:
```
$ rake db:migrate
$ rake db:migrate RACK_ENV=test
```

5. Run the app on a local server: 
```
$ rackup
```
To view the app navigate to: http://localhost:9292/

6. Tests were written with RSpec and Capybara. To run the tests in terminal: 
```
$ cd MakersBnB
$ rspec
```

* Any signed-up user can list a new space.
* Users can list multiple spaces.
* Users should be able to name their space, provide a short description of the space, and a price per night.
* Users should be able to offer a range of dates where their space is available.
* Any signed-up user can request to hire any space for one night, and this should be approved by the user that owns that space.
* Nights for which a space has already been booked should not be available for users to book that space.
* Until a user has confirmed a booking request, that space can still be booked for that night.
